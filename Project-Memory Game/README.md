## Instructions

On first click, the game begins!  Try to use your memory to the best of your ability, to complete the game in the fewest moves possible.  While a timer does show, it does not affect your score in any way.

Your score is based on the number of moves it takes you to complete the game:

**Less than 16 moves**-Congratulations, your memory is amazing, and you get 3 stars!  
**17 to 20 moves**-Pretty good, you made it in a good timeframe, so you get 2 stars!  
**21 or more moves**-I'm sure you have some pretty good traits besides memory, so here's a star for trying!

When you complete the game, a popup window will appear (modal to the techies) and let you know how well you did, and even give you the option to play again.  How nice is that?!?!?

## Dependencies

This game was coded in good, old-fashioned, bland vanilla JavaScript, but updated for ES6.  There is no jQuery, React, or any other frameworks utilized.  The only assets borrowed were the ones given by Udacity--that is, the basic layout for a non-responsive grid and cards, static, no dynamic rendering, and the fonts linked by FontAwesome and Coda.
