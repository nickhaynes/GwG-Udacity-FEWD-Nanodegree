You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
	**Reverse engineering a site, so to speak, to essentially recreate the code that built it in the first place.
	**Organizing and creating a site tree for better organization.
  * What has been easy?
	**So far, a lot has been easy, as I self-taught myself HTML a while ago.
  * What has been difficult?
	**Not so much so far, but I anticipate more issues around the time of JS.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	**By using proper organization to outline a tree and seeing where things go from there.
