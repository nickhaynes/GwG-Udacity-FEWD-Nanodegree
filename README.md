### Description
In January 2018, I was among 15,000 individuals selected for Round 1 of the [Grow with Google](https://grow.google) Front-End Web Developer Scholarship Track offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). In Round 1, scholarship participants learn the basics of web development over 3 months, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
